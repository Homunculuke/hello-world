Counter Strike shooter game plugin modifications


 Counter Strike big fan player. I want to make my own plugins, but can't understand PAWN language wich is used for create plugins for the game. Plugins are modifications or addons to the game where you can put your own designs and change the mod of gaming experience. I only expect somebody point me the way to success. TY!
